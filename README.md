# Manage-WSL-Distro
Status: Alpha; Things are broken, its became tedious trying to get GPT and claude to correctly split output from "wsl --list", through entire sessions and not getting it right, and getting in the way of other projects, this project is on hold. I figured out the best method of how to install ubuntu, and must now attend to more important matters. Its all there below, just needs finishing. Definately will be taking a look at it when 26.04 comes out, if not before if I reinstall. At least I am not left reinstalling entire OS from now on, providing the links continue to work, but it would be a good idea to get it working, and cache some of the appx's.

### PLANNER:
1. Fix any remaining issues.
2. Install a distro, remove a distro.
3. Test an installed distro.
4. Test any remaining features.

### DESCRIPTION:
A tool for offline, listing, installing, removing, Ubuntu installs in WSL. Its early works, but the idea is, its possible to manage installs of Ubuntu ISOs for WSL, while, being offline and without using the Ms Store. You would think this would be as simple as installing other microsoft packages offline with a little command, but NO. This can be extremely useful..
1. if you modify your Windoows os, to not have un-necessary M$ code, such as telemetry and windows update and built-in spyware, then this breaks the store, and fixing the store would otherwise require reinstall of OS.
2. If you have low bandwidth, as the isos are now ~6GB.
3. If you have privacy concerns, with, M$ store or ubuntu distros on the M$ store.
4. If you just want to use the ISOs you already downloaded, such as versions unavailable on the store.

### OUTPUT:
- The current main menu, you get the idea...

## INSALL AND USAGE:
- TBA.

### NOTATION:
- It could potentially do all of this `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands`.
- It Could have some description of GUI, or interface improvement such as arrow controls.
- Delays could be improved, but keeping things slow and simple is probably a good idea, to save on human error and characters used during development.
