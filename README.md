# WinStaLLUrBunToo (Windows Install and WSL, Your-Iso Ubuntu).
A neccessary script, to install a specific Ubuntu iso into WSL/WSL2.

### PLANNER:
1. It may become more later, such as menus to choose which iso, and a linux isos directory, json etc. 
2. IT will be, by default and to start with, the 24.04 LTS, with the user intended to perform a quick hack of the script to change the iso chosen to be installed.

### MOTIVATION:
- The purpose of the project, is to be then able to use wsl2 for amdgpu or at least the libraries, that interest relates to stable diffusion webui performance.
