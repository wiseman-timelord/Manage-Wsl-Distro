# Manage-WSL-Distro.
Status: Alpha; it has already worked, but the overall usefulness of the program is being reviewed and logical supporting features added.

### PLANNER:
1. Test.
2. Fix remaining issues.
3. Install a distro, remove a distro.
4. Test an installed distro.
5. Test any remaining features.
6. Go back to other PROJECTS.

### DESCRIPTION:
A tool for offline, listing, installing, removing, Ubuntu installs in WSL. Its early works, but the idea is, its possible to manage installs of Ubuntu ISOs for WSL, while, being offline and without using the Ms Store. This can be extremely useful..
1. if you modify your Windoows os, to not have un-necessary M$ code, such as telemetry and windows update and built-in spyware, then this breaks the store, and fixing the store would otherwise require reinstall of OS.
2. If you have low bandwidth, as the isos are now ~6GB.
3. If you have privacy concerns, as it is microsofts own copy of ubuntu on the store.
4. If you just want to use the ISOs you already downloaded, such as versions unavailable on the store.
<br> ...You would think this would be as simple as installing other microsoft packages offline with a little command, but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

### OUTPUT:
- The current main menu, you get the idea...
